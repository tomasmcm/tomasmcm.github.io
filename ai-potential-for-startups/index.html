The opportunities it brings can impact startups immensely, helping them streamline operations, reduce costs, and deliver personalised user experiences. This article will explore key AI capabilities and their potential benefits for startups.</p> <h3 id="ai-enabled-document-analysis-the-power-of-black-box-automation">AI-Enabled Document Analysis: The Power of Black-box Automation</h3> <p>Document analysis involves extracting specific information from a document, typically through a precisely defined and rigid rule-based extraction method. However, AI can add a degree of flexibility to this process, enabling the handling of unexpected scenarios more efficiently.</p> <p>These AI methods work essentially as a ‘black box’ where the inner workings are not entirely visible or intuitive but the output is predictive and useful. They improve performance and increase scalability by delivering better results for unstructured data and complex requests.</p> <p>The advantages of black-box automation often outweigh the seeming lack of transparency. Costs for implementing an AI document analysis tool include the initial setting up of the model and prompt customisation followed by ongoing costs which are dependent on the usage and length of documents processed.</p> <h3 id="prompt-engineering-the-art-of-crafting-chatbots">Prompt Engineering: The Art of Crafting Chatbots</h3> <p>Chatbots powered by AI are reshaping customer communication. They are made even more effective and interactive with prompt engineering, a process where AI models are instructed to behave in pre-defined ways or embody specific “characters”.</p> <p>Prompt engineering instructs the chatbot model to answer a user’s queries appropriately and manage areas of absent knowledge effectively. The challenge lies in strategically crafting the prompts and continuously refining them based on user feedback.</p> <h3 id="structured-output-parsing-ensuring-machine-readable-outputs">Structured Output Parsing: Ensuring Machine-Readable Outputs</h3> <p>In a world where businesses interact extensively with AI, there’s a growing demand for structured, machine-readable outputs. This is where the technique of structured output parsing comes in. It allows us to harness the ability of AI models — like OpenAI’s GPT-4 — to enforce a specific output format. This way, the output can be reliably fed into code functions, facilitating seamless integration of AI with existing software systems.</p> <p>Through Structured Output Parsing we can greatly improve the consistency and reliability of the AI models. Costs can be controlled by using a cheaper model, such as GPT-3.5, to handle cases where the output format does not match the expected schema.</p> <h3 id="choosing-between-single-purpose-and-general-purpose-models">Choosing Between Single-Purpose and General-Purpose Models</h3> <p>AI can be broadly categorised into two types of models: single-purpose models and general-purpose models.</p> <p>Single-purpose models are specifically designed for a particular task, such as sentiment analysis, classification, summarisation, or others. They deliver superior performance for their chosen task, at the cost of not being versatile.</p> <p>On the other hand, general-purpose models like Large Language Models (LLMs), can be tweaked to perform many functions with good quality. The tradeoff here is that while they are more adaptable, they might not provide as deep an expertise within certain specialised tasks as a dedicated model.</p> <p>As a startup, your choice between these two will depend on your specific needs. If your requirements are unique, complex, and demanding high accuracy, single-purpose models might be the way to go, and can be more cost-effective. General-purpose models, however, can cover a broad range of functionalities and albeit with a higher cost, making them ideal for startups with a diverse set of AI needs.</p> <p>In summary, AI presents startups with transformative capabilities. Understanding the core applications enables harnessing AI’s potential while aligning solutions with specific startup goals. With proper implementation, AI can unlock new levels of operational efficiency, cost savings and customer satisfaction.</p> </article> <div class="post-meta"> <p></p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="post-navigation"> <div class="container"> <a title="Previous The LLM Cycle" href="/the-llm-cycle/" class="prev"> <span class="h2">Previous</span> <h2 class="h2">The LLM Cycle</h2> </a> <a title="Next A Primer on Large Language Models" href="/llm-primer/" class="next"> <span class="h2">Next</span> <h2 class="h2">A Primer on Large Language Models</h2> </a> </div> </section> </main> <footer class="footer"> <div class="container footer__row"> <section class="footer__section"><h2 class="h2">IPFS</h2> <a title="IPFS Version" href="https://tomasmcm.eth.limo/" target="_blank">Decentralised version</a></section> <section class="footer__section"> <h2 class="h2">Follow</h2> <ul> <li><a title="Twitter" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomasmcm/" target="_blank">Linkedin</a></li> <li><a title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/tomasmcm" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li> <li><a title="Github" href="https://github.com/tomasmcm" target="_blank">Github</a></li> </ul> </section> <section class="footer__section"> <h2 class="h2">More</h2> <ul> <li><a title="Archive" href="/archive/">Archive</a></li> <li><a title="Maker" href="/maker/">Maker</a></li> <li><a title="Blog" href="/blog/">Blog</a></li> </ul> </section> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
